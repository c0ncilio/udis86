Fork of Udis86
==============

Udis86 is a disassembler for the x86 and x86-64 class of instruction set
architectures. It consists of a C library called libudis86 which
provides a clean and simple interface to decode a stream of raw binary
data, and to inspect the disassembled instructions in a structured
manner.
